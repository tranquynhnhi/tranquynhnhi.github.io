1. I could grasp basic ideas of how a website in general and particularly Jekyll based-website work by using the following tutorial:
https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-static-sites-with-jekyll--net-22211
Cons: This website need to be hosted on your github pages ( otherwise the link need to be changed).
(for myself, I renamed this project: jekyllWeb)

2. I have more inside into Jekyll tips with the tutorial:
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/
with his "Jekyll Now".
